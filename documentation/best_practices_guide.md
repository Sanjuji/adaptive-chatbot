   ✅ Good: "We are open Monday to Saturday 9 AM to 8 PM, 
            Sunday 10 AM to 6 PM"
   ```

            is 2-3 days with 30-day warranty on repairs. 
            Free diagnosis. Bring your laptop anytime during 
            business hours."
   ```

3. **Anticipate Follow-up Questions**:
   ```
   Main Answer: "We accept cash, credit/debit cards, UPI, and EMI"
   
   Additional Info: "EMI available on purchases above ₹10,000. 
   UPI payments get 2% cashback. Credit card payments accepted
