## üîß ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Modular Design
```
adaptive_chatbot.py          # Main application with error boundaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple_voice.py          # EdgeTTS integration with resource management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unified_learning_manager.py  # Thread-safe knowledge management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validators.py            # Comprehensive security validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py               # Robust configuration management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.py               # Enhanced logging system
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# 3-Layer Error Handling:
1. Input Validation Layer    # Sanitize and validate all inputs
2. Processing Layer         # Handle business logic errors gracefully  
3. Resource Management Layer # Ensure proper cleanup in all scenarios
```
